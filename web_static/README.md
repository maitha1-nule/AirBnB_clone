In this Project "Webstatic" we are Introduced to the concept of Web development where we were given a small inroduction to html 'Sir Berners-Lee, who invented html' and we use it. I learded about html andcass togehter with how to create web pages.

     HTML

HTML is more like the a skinless person what to i mean, without a skin it is proben that a human being looks very bad so inorder to hide it, we were given one. The boiler plate if it is:
<!Doctype html> #tells the browser the version of html were using
<html>
</head>
<body>           #NOTE THE TAGS ARE CLOSSED
</body>
</html>

	CSS
Cascading Style sheet basically known as css is used to style a web page. Remember the 'skinnless person' now it is thanks tocss that we are able to give a person a skin hence making him appear to either be handsome or beutiful.
Its thanks to css what we are able to style our webapages after they have been created.
We can use it inline using
	<style> </style> tags
and in a another scenario in the head sme tags again and ouside in another place with an extension .css
and can be ascesssed from the html page using <link rel="stylesheet" href="name.css"/>
